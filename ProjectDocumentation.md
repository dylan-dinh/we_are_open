The members of this team are: 
  - Dylan Dinh as General Manager and Developper

## 2.What is the app about

We Are Open is an application designed for Business owners and business managers who has their business in apps like Google Business or Facebook so that they can manage their opening hours and post events in all the different platforms from a centralized APP. 

## 3.Tools used to create the app

  - React Native: React Native is a cross-platform framework based on JavaScript. With it you can develop the android and IOS versions of your app at the same time.
  - Firebase: Firebase is a Database facilitying tool from Google. It saves work on developing the database system as it offers this database funcionality as an API. It's a cross-platform element, meaning it can be used for the android and the IOS vrsions of our app.

## 4.Planning and Methodology

When we had the team formed and team members were on the task, we had a meeting to plan the App Development process. We decided to choose SCRUM Methodology, as an Agile method was the most suitable for our situation. 
In Scrum development we use sprints to develop different functionalities. Each sprint planning meeting is described in terms of the desired outcome (a commitment to a set of features to be developed in the next sprint) instead of a set of Entry criteria, Task definitions, Validation criteria, Exit criteria (ETVX) and so on, as would be provided in most methodologies. The evolution of our project can be seen in this terms of the desired outcome of each sprint:
  - Initial Srint 
  The first funcionalities of the app: Registration using the firebase database system connected to the app.
  -Second sprint
  Continuing with funcionalities: LogIn process as well as persistance of login in the app inside the device.
  -Third sprint
  First API implemention: post event using Facebook API.
  -Fourth sprint
  Last funtionality: implementiation of change in Opening hours
